# Application_control_using_Apache_Webserver

Install Apache web server in Raspberry Pi to control the LED from a webpage that can be accessed from anywhere over the internet.Here we control an LED, connected to Raspberry Pi by using Apache web server. For this we create an html/php web page which has two buttons - one for turning on the LED and second for turning off the LED.It can be futher modified into Home Automation by adding additional appliances to it.

### What is Webserver?

A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.

### Components Required

- Raspberry pi board (With Raspbian operating system)
- LED
- 250 ohm resistor
- Jumper Wires

### Connection
 
The connections in this project are quite simple - positive pin of LED is connected to GPIO 21 pin and the negative to a 270 ohm resistor, the other side of which is connected to GND pin.

### Installing WiringPi Library

WiringPi is a PIN based GPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835, BCM2836 and BCM2837 SoC devices used in all Raspberry Pi versions. Itâ€™s released under the GNU LGPLv3 license and is usable from C, C++ and RTB (BASIC) as well as many other languages with suitable wrappers.

Open command prompt and run following command
```
sudo apt-get purge wiringpi
```
```
hash -r
```
- Now obtain WiringPi using git by this command:
```
git clone --branch final_official_2.50 https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi.git 
```
-  Then install WiringPi library using:
```
~/wiringpi
```
```
cd ~/wiringPi
```
```
./build
```
### Install Websever

- Install Apache web server using following commands:
```
sudo apt-get install apache2
```
- Now, install the apache2 package by using this command command in terminal:
```
sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php
```

- To check server is working or not, search ip address of your raspberry pi.
- By default, Apache puts a test HTML file in the web folder. This default web page is served when you browse to http://192.168.0.103 (whatever the Pi's IP address is) from another computer on the network.
